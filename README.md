# Udacity FEND: Neighborhood Map
This is a map of in Morelia, the capital city in the Mexican state of Michoacan. The map has coffee houses, hotels, and monuments. This was completed as part of Udacity's Frontend Nanodegree program.

## Using the Neighborhood Map
To use the map download all of the files from the github repository and open src/index.html in your preferred browser. When a location is clicked a popup window will display a picture of the location, address and contact information. Type in the search terms displayed in bubbles to narrow down locations based on preferred criteria (e.g. hotel, coffee, history).
